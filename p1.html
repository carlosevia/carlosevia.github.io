<p>Here it is the groove slightly transformed, just a bit of a break from the norm. Just a little somethin' to break the monotony of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be a little bit out of control. It's cool to dance, but what about the groove that soothes, that moves? Romance. Give me a soft subtle mix, and if ain't broke then don't try to fix it.
