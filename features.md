title: "Features of the DITA Open Toolkit"
---

The DITA Open Toolkit is primarily a publishing tool – it is intended to convert DITA content into various output formats. This topic describes which versions of DITA are supported as input; it also describes the output formats available in a default installation.

Supported versions of DITA
--------------------------

The toolkit supports all standard versions of DITA, including 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. In addition, it will still process documents that were written according to the pre-OASIS version of DITA, often called "dita132".

Supported transformation types
------------------------------

The following transformation types are supported out of the box with any toolkit installation:

* **PDF** -
         PDF output is based on a plug-in that produces XSL-FO
         output. The XSL-FO output may be converted to PDF using
         an open source tools (Apache FOP) or using commercial
         tools such as RenderX or Antenna House Formatter.

* **XHTML** -
         XHTML output is supported together with a variety of
         XHTML-based navigation types. Navigation is not
         required. The XHTML output contains class values based
         on the DITA elements so CSS files may be used to
         customize the output style.

* **Eclipse Help** -
         Eclipse output is an XHTML based format that also
         produces navigation and index files for use with Eclipse
         information centers.

* **TocJS**
         The TocJS transformation type includes XHTML output
         along with JavaScript based frames for navigation,
         including TOC sections that expand and collapse.

* **HTML Help** -
         Microsoft Compiled HTML Help output produces a compiled
         help (.chm) file with the XHTML topics, table of
         contents, and index.

* **Java Help** -
         Java Help includes a table of contents and index for use
         with the Java Help platform.

* **OpenDocument** -
         ODT is a document format based on the ODF standard, for
         use with tools like Open Office.

* **Rich Text Format** -
         RTF output is supported for basic content, but complex
         markup and some advanced features of DITA may not be
         supported.

* **troff** -
         troff based man pages are supported; one man page is
         generated for each input topic. Note that tables are not
         supported by this transformation type.

The toolkit’s plug-in mechanism allows new transformation types to be added. Note that both TocJS and PDF2 were originally separately installable plug-ins, which became widespread enough that they are now bundled together with the default toolkit installation.
